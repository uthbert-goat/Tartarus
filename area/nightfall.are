the ancient dracolich~
The massive skeleton of an ancient dragon rises in fury!
~
This massive dracolich was once one of the greatest red dragons ever to
live.  In death the greater lords of darkness gathered it's form and used
the most unholy of magics to animate the corpse into a new phase of
existence.  The mortal flesh was shed and only the skeletal form was
presevered.  It's mind was then gathered from the shadows and reinstituted
into the new form, allowing It to once again walk the mortal planes as a
major free-willed undead.  Now it serves as It's lord's main form of
transport, enjoying the privilages it gets from such a duty.

On a ledge on a high mountain~
You find yourself at the top of a mountain upon on a wide ledge
overlooking a blighted wasteland.  Darkness cloaks most of the land,
obsuring your view of it, but what you see is enough make you shiver in
fear.  A ledge heads west around the mountain or you can descend it on a
path going down.

upon which withered, desicated corpses hang crucified in some horrific

This darkened room reminds you of a crypt.  Nothing stirs, not even the
wind, and even cries of agony and despair seem muted and far off.  Statues
of the many of the greater demons and devils of the Abyss' 666 layers have
been erected here: Orcus, Demogorgon, Pazuzus, Asmodeus, Bael, Molok and
others stare back at you with such intensity you feel yourself cringing.  A
landing lies south and to the east a door blocks the way but not the
prescence of something unspeakable.

In a dimly lit tunnel~
Dull yellow lamps provide light in the tunnel. Around you dwarves scurry 
past in hurried perperation for some coming battle. To the north is a 
side corridor, while the tunnel continues east and west.

On a town road covered by mist~
You walk through a seemingly dead town. The darkness here is like some 
permenant feature, like the strange mists that hang over the entire 
valley. Somewhere nearby you think you hear the faint scraping of what 
sounds like feet. The road continues north and south.

The captains room~
The captain of the dwarves appears to have set up a make-shift

itinerarys are strewn all about. Seems like he's not much into neatness 
even if he does like to be meticulous. The door leads back west.

what looks like a filling meal.  Around you the equipment of some
adventurers has been piled against the walls, much of it of fine make but of
little practical use to any not learned in the item's ways.  The only

A bend in the dark rocky pathway~
The path through the mountains is subdued and darkened.  On the ground
small pools of dark liquid have accumulated and congealed.  At a second
glance you realise it is blood and that the drops are quite recent; it
almost seems as if someone has been dragged through here.  Some statues of
huge demonic beings have been erected here.  Life size busts of many greater
demons such as Orcus and Demogorgon line the pathway.  The passage bends
around the moutains here and heads south to some large structure or west to
a large mountain.

In a gutted hallway~
The hall of this old townhall leaves a lot to be desired in the way of
upkeep. Burnt wooden frames and corroded steel make of most of it.  The
rest is just dirty walls and leaking roofs.  To the west is a small side
room while the hall itself continues north and east.

Before the bone gates~
The pathway through the mountains ends here at a huge set of gates made
of bone.  A pair of huge arching spines constitute the frame of the gate
while blackened and charred plates of over-lapping demon bone cascade down
to fill in the gate's body.  It is beyond comprehension what could sort of
creature could have had such bones.  The path leads north into the
mountains, while trough the gateway you can hear faint sounds of demonic
laughter....

An snowbound mountainside~
You find yourself trudging knee-deep in snow as you navigate the freezing 
mountainside. All around you is white snow and shattered ice. In the 
distance you hear something's roar echo through the mountain.

The lair of the white dragon~
You stand in a large iced-over clearing of rocks.  Snow lies thickly over
everything, covering up most, but not all, of the bones that lie scattered
around.  Something huge lives here, something huge and very cold.

At the end of a pier over the black lake~
You stand at the end of the pier but mist hangs heavily over the lake
blocking most of the view.  It is from here that Charon the boatkeeper takes
some the lost souls to hell and you had best not interfere with any of the
ghostly avatars he sends to conduct his work here.

On an unused road in a misty valley~
You walk along a dirty old road that looks as if it hasn't been used for 
a long, long time. Mist hangs heavily in the air blocking out much of 
the light and making it seem like perpetual night covers the valley.
The roadway leads east and west.

At a gate in the misty road~
You walk along a dirty old road that looks as if it hasn't been used for
a long, long time.  Mist hangs heavily in the air blocking out much of the
light and making it seem like perpetual night covers the valley.  Finally
you stumble into a broken, rusty gate that hangs loosely in the wind.  On
the other side the mist hangs even more heavily and all you can see is a
dark open area with large moving shapes within it.  The road itself leads
back east while the clearing opens out to the west.

Lost in a misty field~
These fields span an incredible area. They must've been once used for 
the town crops and animals, but now they are blighted and rocky. The 
mist embraces you with a cold chill as if trying to absorb you into the 
eternal devestation of the land. All around you shapes move decadently 
in the shadows.
